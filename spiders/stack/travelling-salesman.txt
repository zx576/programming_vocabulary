 Brute Force Algorithm

 A path through every vertex exactly once is the same as ordering the vertex in some way. Thus, to calculate the minimum cost of travelling through every vertex exactly once, we can brute force every single one of the  N!  permutations of the numbers from  1  to  N . 
 Psuedocode 
 minimum = INF
for all permutations P

    current = 0                                

    for i from 0 to N-2
        current = current + cost[P[i]][P[i+1]]  <- Add the cost of going from 1 vertex to the next
    
    current = current + cost[P[N-1]][P[0]]      <- Add the cost of going from last vertex to the first

    if current < minimum                        <- Update minimum if necessary
        minimum = current
    
output minimum
 
 Time Complexity 
 There are  N!  permutations to go through and the cost of each path is calculated in  O(N) , thus this algorithm takes  O(N * N!)  time to output the exact answer.

 Notice that if we consider the path (in order): 
 (1,2,3,4,6,0,5,7)
 
 and the path 
 (1,2,3,5,0,6,7,4) 
 
 The cost of going from vertex  1  to vertex  2  to vertex  3  remains the same, so why must it be recalculated? This result can be saved for later use. 
 Let  dp[bitmask][vertex]  represent the minimum cost of travelling through all the vertices whose corresponding bit in  bitmask  is set to  1  ending at  vertex . For example: 
 dp[12][2] 

   12   =   1 1 0 0
            ^ ^ 
vertices:   3 2 1 0
 
 Since  12  represents  1100  in binary,  dp[12][2]  represents going through vertices  2  and  3  in the graph with the path ending at vertex 2. 
 Thus we can have the following algorithm (C++ implementation): 
 int cost[N][N];                        //Adjust the value of N if needed
int memo[1 << N][N];                   //Set everything here to -1
int TSP(int bitmask, int pos){
    int cost = INF;
    if (bitmask == ((1 << N) - 1)){      //All vertices have been explored
        return cost[pos][0];             //Cost to go back
    }
    if (memo[bitmask][pos] != -1){       //If this has already been computed
        return memo[bitmask][pos];       //Just return the value, no need to recompute
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i){         //For every vertex 
        if ((bitmask & (1 << i)) == 0){  //If the vertex has not been visited
            cost = min(cost,TSP(bitmask | (1 << i) , i) + cost[pos][i]);   //Visit the vertex
        } 
    }
    memo[bitmask][pos] = cost;           //Save the result
    return cost;
}
//Call TSP(1,0)
 
 This line may be a little confusing, so lets go through it slowly: 
 cost = min(cost,TSP(bitmask | (1 << i) , i) + cost[pos][i]);
 
 Here,  bitmask | (1 << i)  sets the ith bit of  bitmask  to 1, which represents that the ith vertex has been visited. The  i  after the comma represents the new  pos  in that function call, which represents the new "last" vertex.  cost[pos][i]  is to add the cost of travelling from vertex  pos  to vertex  i . 
 Thus, this line is to update the value of  cost  to the minimum possible value of travelling to every other vertex that has not been visited yet. 
 Time Complexity 
 The function  TSP(bitmask,pos)  has  2^N  values for  bitmask  and  N  values for  pos . Each function takes  O(N)  time to run (the  for  loop). Thus this implementation takes  O(N^2 * 2^N)  time to output the exact answer.

 Remarks 
 The Travelling Salesman Problem is the problem of finding the minimum cost of travelling through  N  vertices exactly once per vertex. There is a cost  cost[i][j]  to travel from vertex  i  to vertex  j . 
 There are 2 types of algorithms to solve this problem:
