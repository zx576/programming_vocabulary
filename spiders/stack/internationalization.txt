 Setting up 
 settings.py 
 from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

USE_I18N = True  # Enable Internationalization
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'  # Language in which original texts are written
LANGUAGES = [  # Available languages
    ('en', _("English")),
    ('de', _("German")),
    ('fr', _("French")),
]

# Make sure the LocaleMiddleware is included, AFTER SessionMiddleware
# and BEFORE middlewares using internationalization (such as CommonMiddleware)
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
   'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
   'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
   'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
]
 
 Marking strings as translatable 
 The first step in translation is is to  mark strings as translatable . This is passing them through one of the  gettext  functions (See the  Syntax section ). For instance, here is an example model definition: 
 from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
# It is common to import gettext as the shortcut `_` as it is often used
# several times in the same file.

class Child(models.Model):

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = _("child")
        verbose_name_plural = _("children")

    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30, verbose_name=_("first name"))
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30, verbose_name=_("last name"))
    age = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(verbose_name=_("age"))
 
 All strings encapsulated in  _()  are now marked as translatable. When printed, they will always be displayed as the encapsulated string, whatever the chosen language (since no translation is available yet). 
 Translating strings 
 This example is sufficient to get started with translation. Most of the time you will only want to mark strings as translatable to  anticipate prospective internationalization  of your project. Thus, this is covered  in another example .

 Common pitfalls 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 fuzzy translations 
 Sometimes  makemessages  may think that the string it found for translation is somewhat similar to already existing translation. It will when mark it in the  .po  file with a special  fuzzy  comment like this: 
 #: templates/randa/map.html:91
#, fuzzy
msgid "Country"
msgstr "Länderinfo"
 
 Even if translation is correct or you updated it to correct one it will not be used to translate your project unless you remove  fuzzy  comment line. 
 Multiline strings 
 makemessages  parses files in various formats, from plain text to python code and it is not designed to follow every possible rule for having multi-line strings in those formats. Most of the time it will work just fine with single line strings but if you have construction like this: 
 translation = _("firstline"
"secondline"
"thirdline")
 
 It will only pick up  firstline  for translation. Solution for this is to avoid using multiline strings when possible.

 Lazy vs Non-Lazy translation 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 When using non-lazy translation, strings are translated immediately. 
 >>> from django.utils.translation import activate, ugettext as _
>>> month = _("June")
>>> month
'June'
>>> activate('fr')
>>> _("June")
'juin'
>>> activate('de')
>>> _("June")
'Juni'
>>> month
'June'
 
 When using laziness, translation only occurs when actually used. 
 >>> from django.utils.translation import activate, ugettext_lazy as _
>>> month = _("June")
>>> month
<django.utils.functional.lazy.<locals>.__proxy__ object at 0x7f61cb805780>
>>> str(month)
'June'
>>> activate('fr')
>>> month
<django.utils.functional.lazy.<locals>.__proxy__ object at 0x7f61cb805780>
>>> "month: {}".format(month)
'month: juin'
>>> "month: %s" % month
'month: Juni'
 
 You have to use lazy translation in cases where: 
 
 Translation may not be activated (language not selected) when  _("some string")  is evaluated 
 Some strings may be evaluated only at startup (eg. in class attributes such as model and form fields definitions)

 Noop use case 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 (u)gettext_noop  allows you to mark a string as translatable without actually translating it. 
 A typical use case is when you want to log a message for developers (in English) but also want to display it to the client (in the requested language).  You can pass a variable to  gettext , but its content won't be discovered as a translatable string because it is, per definition, variable. . 
 # THIS WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED
import logging 
from django.contrib import messages

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

error_message = "Oops, something went wrong!"
logger.error(error_message)
messages.error(request, _(error_message))
 
 The error message won't appear in the  .po  file and you will have to remember it exists to add it manually. To fix this, you can use  gettext_noop . 
 error_message = ugettext_noop("Oops, something went wrong!")
logger.error(error_message)
messages.error(request, _(error_message))
 
 Now the string  "Oops, something went wrong!"  will be discovered and available in the  .po  file when generated. And the error will still be logged in English for developers.

 Translating strings 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 To translate strings, you will have to create translation files. To do so, django ships with the management command  makemessages . 
 $ django-admin makemessages -l fr
processing locale fr
 
 The above command will discover all strings marked as translatable within your installed apps and create one language file for each app for french translation. For instance, if you have only one app  myapp  containing translatable strings, this will create a file  myapp/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/django.po . This file may look like the following: 
 # SOME DESCRIPTIVE TITLE
# Copyright (C) YEAR THE PACKAGE'S COPYRIGHT HOLDER
# This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package.
# FIRST AUTHOR <EMAIL@ADDRESS>, YEAR
#
#, fuzzy
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2016-07-24 14:01+0200\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"
"Last-Translator: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>\n"
"Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>\n"
"Language: \n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

#: myapp/models.py:22
msgid "user"
msgstr ""

#: myapp/models.py:39
msgid "A user already exists with this email address."
msgstr ""

#: myapp/templates/myapp/register.html:155
#, python-format
msgid ""
"By signing up, you accept our <a href=\"%(terms_url)s\" "
"target=_blank>Terms of services</a>."
msgstr ""
 
 You will first have to fill in the placeholders (emphasized with uppercases). Then translate the strings.  msgid  is the string marked as translatable in your code.  msgstr  is where you have to write the translation of the string right above. 
 When a string contains placeholders, you will have to include them in your translation as well. For instance, you will translate the latest message as the following: 
 #: myapp/templates/myapp/register.html:155
#, python-format
msgid ""
"By signing up, you accept our <a href=\"%(terms_url)s\" "
"target=_blank>Terms of services</a>."
msgstr ""
"En vous inscrivant, vous acceptez nos <a href=\"%(terms_url)s\" "
"target=_blank>Conditions d'utilisation</a>"
 
 Once your translation file is completed, you will have to compile the  .po  files into  .mo  files. This is done by calling the  compilemessages  management command: 
 $ django-admin compilemessages
 
 That's it, now translations are available. 
 To update your translation files when you make changes to your code, you can rerun  django-admin makemessages -l fr . This will update  .po  files, keeping your existing translations and adding the new ones. Deleted strings will still be available in comments. To update  .po  files for all languages, run  django-admin makemessages -a . Once your  .po  files are updated, don't forget to run  django-admin compilemessages  again to generate  .mo  files.

 Translation in templates 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 To enable translation in templates you must load the  i18n  library. 
 {% load i18n %}
 
 Basic translation is made with the  trans  template tag. 
 {% trans "Some translatable text" %}
{# equivalent to python `ugettext("Some translatable text")` #}
 
 The  trans  template tag supports context: 
 {% trans "May" context "month" %}
{# equivalent to python `pgettext("May", "month")` #}
 
 To include placeholders in your translation string, as in: 
 _("My name is {first_name} {last_name}").format(first_name="John", last_name="Doe")
 
 You will have to use the  blocktrans  template tag: 
 {% blocktrans with first_name="John" last_name="Doe" %}
  My name is {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}
{% endblocktrans %}
 
 Of course instead of  "John"  and  "Doe"  you can have variables and filters: 
 {% blocktrans with first_name=user.first_name last_name=user.last_name|title %}
  My name is {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}
{% endblocktrans %}
 
 If  first_name  and  last_name  are already in your context, you can even omit the  with  clause: 
 {% blocktrans %}My name is {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}{% endblocktrans %}
 
 However, only "top-level" context variables can be use.  This will NOT work: 
 {% blocktrans %}
    My name is {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}
{% endblocktrans %}
 
 This is mainly because the variable name is used as placeholder in translation files. 
 The  blocktrans  template tag also accepts pluralization. 
 {% blocktrans count nb=users|length }}
    There is {{ nb }} user.
{% plural %}
    There are {{ nb }} users.
{% endblocktrans %}
 
 Finally, regardless of the  i18n  library, you can pass translatable strings to template tags using the  _("")  syntax. 
 {{ site_name|default:_("It works!") }}
{% firstof var1 var2 _("translatable fallback") %}
 
 This is some magic built-in django template system to mimic a function call syntax but this ain't a function call.  _("It works!")  passed to the  default  template tag as a string  '_("It works!")'  which is then parsed a translatable string, just as  name  would be parsed as a variable and  "name"  would be parsed as a string.
