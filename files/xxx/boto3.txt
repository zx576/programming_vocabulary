Boto 3 - The AWS SDK for Python 
       
 
 Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for
Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use
of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. You can find the latest, most
up to date, documentation at  Read the Docs , including a list of
services that are supported. To see only those features which have been
released, check out the  stable docs . 
 
 Quick Start 
 First, install the library and set a default region: 
 $ pip install boto3 
 Next, set up credentials (in e.g.  ~/.aws/credentials ): 
 [default] 
 aws_access_key_id  = YOUR_KEY
 aws_secret_access_key  = YOUR_SECRET 
 Then, set up a default region (in e.g.  ~/.aws/config ): 
 [default] 
 region =us-east-1 
 Then, from a Python interpreter: 
 >> >   import  boto3
 >> >  s3  =  boto3.resource( ' s3 ' )
 >> >   for  bucket  in  s3.buckets.all():
         print (bucket.name) 
 
 Development 
 
 Getting Started 
 Assuming that you have Python and  virtualenv  installed, set up your
environment and install the required dependencies like this instead of
the  pip install boto3  defined above: 
 $ git clone https://github.com/boto/boto3.git
$  cd  boto3
$ virtualenv venv
...
$  .  venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -e  . 
 
 Running Tests 
 You can run tests in all supported Python versions using  tox . By default,
it will run all of the unit and functional tests, but you can also specify your own
 nosetests  options. Note that this requires that you have all supported
versions of Python installed, otherwise you must pass  -e  or run the
 nosetests  command directly: 
 $ tox
$ tox -- unit/test_session.py
$ tox -e py26,py33 -- integration/ 
 You can also run individual tests with your default Python version: 
 $ nosetests tests/unit 
 
 Generating Documentation 
 Sphinx is used for documentation. You can generate HTML locally with the
following: 
 $ pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
$  cd  docs
$ make html
