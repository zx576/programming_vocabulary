 Features 
 Did someone say features? 
 
 Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, and Linux are officially supported. 
 
 Works with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and PyPy.  (But you don't have to
know/write Python code to use Cookiecutter.) 
 
 Project templates can be in any programming language or markup format:
Python, JavaScript, Ruby, CoffeeScript, RST, Markdown, CSS, HTML, you name
it. You can use multiple languages in the same project template. 
 
 Simple command line usage: 
 
 #  Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template 
 #  You'll be prompted to enter values. 
 #  Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory, 
 #  based on those values. 
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
 #  For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix 
$ cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage 
 
 
 Use it at the command line with a local template: 
 
 #  Create project in the current working directory, from the local 
 #  cookiecutter-pypackage/ template 
$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/ 
 
 
 Or use it from Python: 
 
 from  cookiecutter.main  import  cookiecutter

 #  Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template 
cookiecutter( ' cookiecutter-pypackage/ ' )

 #  Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template 
cookiecutter( ' https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git ' ) 
 
 
 Directory names and filenames can be templated. For example: 
 {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.py
 
 
 Supports unlimited levels of directory nesting. 
 
 100% of templating is done with Jinja2. This includes file and directory names. 
 
 Simply define your template variables in a  cookiecutter.json  file. For example: 
 
 {
     " full_name " :  " Audrey Roy " ,
     " email " :  " audreyr@gmail.com " ,
     " project_name " :  " Complexity " ,
     " repo_name " :  " complexity " ,
     " project_short_description " :  " Refreshingly simple static site generator. " ,
     " release_date " :  " 2013-07-10 " ,
     " year " :  " 2013 " ,
     " version " :  " 0.1.1 " 
} 
 
 
 Unless you suppress it with  --no-input , you are prompted for input: 
 
 Prompts are the keys in  cookiecutter.json . 
 Default responses are the values in  cookiecutter.json . 
 Prompts are shown in order. 
 
 
 Cross-platform support for  ~/.cookiecutterrc  files: 
 
 default_context :
     full_name :  " Audrey Roy " 
     email :  " audreyr@gmail.com " 
     github_username :  " audreyr " 
 cookiecutters_dir :  " ~/.cookiecutters/ " 
 
 
 Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into
 ~/.cookiecutters/  by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified. 
 
 If you have already cloned a cookiecutter into  ~/.cookiecutters/ , you
can reference it by directory name: 
 
 #  Clone cookiecutter-pypackage 
$ cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
 #  Now you can use the already cloned cookiecutter by name 
$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage 
 
 
 You can use local cookiecutters, or remote cookiecutters directly from Git
repos or from Mercurial repos on Bitbucket. 
 
 Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want used as defaults
whenever you generate a project 
 
 Inject extra context with command-line arguments: 
 
 $ cookiecutter --no-input gh:msabramo/cookiecutter-supervisor program_name=foobar startsecs=10 
 
 
 Direct access to the Cookiecutter API allows for injection of extra context. 
 
 Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after
generating a project. 
 
 Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative. 
 
 Projects are always generated to your current directory. 
 
 
 
 Available Cookiecutters 
 Making great cookies takes a lot of cookiecutters and contributors. We're so
pleased that there are many Cookiecutter project templates to choose from. We
hope you find a cookiecutter that is just right for your needs.

 Continuous Delivery 
 If you don't find a cookiecutter that suits your needs here, please consider
writing or suggesting one. We wish for our users to find a solution for their
use cases, and we provide a list of other projects that we do not maintain for
your convenience (please see the  Similar Projects  section). 
 
 Community 
 The core committer team is  @audreyr ,  @pydanny ,  @michaeljoseph ,
 @pfmoore , and  @hackebrot . We
welcome you and invite you to participate. 
 Stuck? Try one of the following: 
 
 See the  Troubleshooting  page. 
 Ask for help on  Stack Overflow . 
 You are strongly encouraged to  file an issue  about the problem, even if
it's just "I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter" with a link to your
cookiecutter. Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly. 
 Ask for help on  Gitter  if you must (but please try one of the other
options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion) 
 
 Development on Cookiecutter is community-driven: 
 
 Huge thanks to all the  contributors  who have pitched in to help make
Cookiecutter an even better tool. 
 Everyone is invited to contribute. Read the  contributing instructions ,
then get started. 
 
 Connect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users on  Gitter : 
 
 https://gitter.im/audreyr/cookiecutter  (note: due to work and commitments,
a core committer might not always be available) 
 
 Encouragement is unbelievably motivating. If you want more work done on
Cookiecutter, show support: 
 
 Thank a core committer for their efforts.

 Got criticism or complaints? 
 
 File an issue  so that Cookiecutter can be improved. Be friendly
and constructive about what could be better. Make detailed suggestions. 
 Keep us in the loop so that we can help.  For example, if you are
discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list,  file an issue 
where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc at least 1 core committer on
the email. 
 Be encouraging. A comment like "This function ought to be rewritten like
this" is much more likely to result in action than a comment like "Eww, look
how bad this function is." 
 
 Waiting for a response to an issue/question? 
 
 Be patient and persistent. All issues are on the core committer team's radar and
will be considered thoughtfully, but we have a lot of issues to work through. If
urgent, it's fine to ping a core committer in the issue with a reminder. 
 Ask others to comment, discuss, review, etc. 
 Search the Cookiecutter repo for issues related to yours. 
 Need a fix/feature/release/help urgently, and can't wait?  @audreyr  is
