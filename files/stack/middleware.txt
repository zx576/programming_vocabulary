 Understanding Django 1.10 middleware's new style 
 
 
 
 
 
 10 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 Django 1.10 introduced a new middleware style where  process_request  and  process_response  are merged together. 
 In this new style,  a middleware is a callable that returns another callable . Well, actually the  former is a middleware factory  and  the latter is the actual middleware . 
 The  middleware factory  takes as single argument the next  middleware  in the middlewares stack, or the view itself when the bottom of the stack is reached. 
 The  middleware  takes the request as single argument and  always returns an  HttpResponse . 
 The best example to illustrate how new-style  middleware  works is probably to show how to make a backward-compatible  middleware : 
 class MyMiddleware:

    def __init__(self, next_layer=None):
        """We allow next_layer to be None because old-style middlewares
        won't accept any argument.
        """
        self.get_response = next_layer

    def process_request(self, request):
        """Let's handle old-style request processing here, as usual."""
        # Do something with request
        # Probably return None
        # Or return an HttpResponse in some cases

    def process_response(self, request, response):
        """Let's handle old-style response processing here, as usual."""
        # Do something with response, possibly using request.
        return response

    def __call__(self, request):
        """Handle new-style middleware here."""
        response = self.process_request(request)
        if response is None:
            # If process_request returned None, we must call the next middleware or
            # the view. Note that here, we are sure that self.get_response is not
            # None because this method is executed only in new-style middlewares.
            response = self.get_response(request)
        response = self.process_response(request, response)
        return response

 Middleware to filter by IP address 
 
 
 
 
 
 9 
 
 
 First: The path structure 
 If you don't have it you need to create the  middleware  folder within your app following the structure: 
 yourproject/yourapp/middleware
 
 The folder middleware should be placed in the same folder as settings.py, urls, templates... 
 Important: Don't forget to create the  init .py empty file inside the middleware folder so your app recognizes this folder 
 Instead of having a separate folder containing your middleware classes, it is also possible to put your functions in a single file,  yourproject/yourapp/middleware.py . 
 Second: Create the middleware 
 Now we should create a file for our custom middleware. In this example let's suppose we want a middleware that filter the users based on their IP address, we create a file called  filter_ip_middleware.py : 
 #yourproject/yourapp/middleware/filter_ip_middleware.py
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied    

class FilterIPMiddleware(object):
    # Check if client IP address is allowed
    def process_request(self, request):
        allowed_ips = ['192.168.1.1', '123.123.123.123', etc...] # Authorized ip's
        ip = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR') # Get client IP address
        if ip not in allowed_ips:
            raise PermissionDenied # If user is not allowed raise Error

       # If IP address is allowed we don't do anything
       return None
 
 Third: Add the middleware in our 'settings.py' 
 We need to look for the  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES  inside the settings.py and there we need to add our middleware ( Add it in the last position ). It should be like: 
 MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
     # Above are Django standard middlewares

     # Now we add here our custom middleware
     'yourapp.middleware.filter_ip_middleware.FilterIPMiddleware'
)
 
 Done!  Now every request from every client will call your custom middleware and process your custom code!

                ados.run.push(function () { ados_add_placement(22,499571,"adzerk1575316218",4).setZone(30); });

 Add data to requests 
 
 
 
 
 
 6 
 
 
 Django makes it really easy to add additional data onto requests for use within the view.  For example, we can parse out the subdomain on the request's META and attach it as a separate property on the request by using middleware. 
 class SubdomainMiddleware:
    def process_request(self, request):
        """
        Parse out the subdomain from the request
        """
        host = request.META.get('HTTP_HOST', '')
        host_s = host.replace('www.', '').split('.')
        request.subdomain = None
        if len(host_s) > 2:
            request.subdomain = host_s[0]
 
 If you add data with middleware to your request, you can access that newly added data further down the line.  Here we'll use the parsed subdomain to determine something like what organization is accessing your application.  This approach is useful for apps that are deployed with a DNS setup with wildcard subdomains that all point to a single instance and the person accessing the app wants a skinned version dependent on the access point. 
 class OrganizationMiddleware:
    def process_request(self, request):
        """
        Determine the organization based on the subdomain
        """
        try:
            request.org = Organization.objects.get(domain=request.subdomain)
        except Organization.DoesNotExist:
            request.org = None
 
 Remember that order matters when having middleware depend on one another.  For requests, you'll want the dependent middleware to be placed after the dependency. 
 MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
    ...
    'myapp.middleware.SubdomainMiddleware',
    'myapp.middleware.OrganizationMiddleware',
    ...
]

 Globally handling exception 
 
 
 
 
 
 5 
 
 
 Say you have implemented some logic to detect attempts to modify an object in the database while the client that submitted changes didn't have the latest modifications. If such case happens, you raise a custom exception  ConfictError(detailed_message) . 
 Now you want to return an  HTTP 409 (Confict)  status code when this error occurs. You may typically use as middleware for this instead of handling it in each view that might raise this exception. 
 class ConfictErrorHandlingMiddleware:
    def process_exception(self, request, exception):
        if not isinstance(exception, ConflictError):
            return  # Propagate other exceptions, we only handle ConflictError
        context = dict(confict_details=str(exception))
        return TemplateResponse(request, '409.html', context, status=409)

 Remarks 
 Middleware needs to be added to your settings.py  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES  list before it will be included in execution.  The default list that Django provides when creating a new project is as follows: 
 MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]
 
 These are all functions that will run in  order  on every request (once before it reaches your view code in  views.py  and once in reverse order for  process_response  callback, before version 1.10). They do a variety of things such as injecting the  Cross Site Request Forgery (csrf)  token. 
 The order matters because if some middleware does a redirect, then the all the subsequent middleware will never run. Or if a middleware expects the csrf token to be there, it has to run after the  CsrfViewMiddleware .
