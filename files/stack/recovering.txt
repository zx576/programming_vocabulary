 Recover a deleted branch 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 To recover a deleted branch you need to find the commit which was the head of your deleted branch by running 
 git reflog
 
 You can then recreate the branch by running 
 git checkout -b <branch-name> <sha1-of-commit>
 
 You will not be able to recover deleted branches if git's  garbage collector  deleted dangling commits - those without refs. Always have a backup of your repository, especially when you work in a small team / proprietary project

 Recover from git stash 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 To get your most recent stash after running git stash, use 
 git stash apply
 
 To see a list of your stashes, use 
 git stash list
 
 You will get a list that looks something like this 
 stash@{0}: WIP on master: 67a4e01 Merge tests into develop
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 70f0d95 Add user role to localStorage on user login
 
 Choose a different git stash to restore with the number that shows up for the stash you want 
 git stash apply stash@{2}
 
 You can also choose 'git stash pop', it works same as 'git stash apply' like.. 
  git stash pop 
 
 or 
  git stash pop stash@{2}
 
 Difference in git stash apply and git stash pop... 
 git stash pop :- stash data will be remove from stack of stash list. 
 Ex:- 
 git stash list
 
 You will get a list that looks something like this 
 stash@{0}: WIP on master: 67a4e01 Merge tests into develop
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 70f0d95 Add user role to localStorage on user login
 
 Now pop stash data using command 
 git stash pop
 
 Again Check for stash list 
 git stash list
 
 You will get a list that looks something like this 
  stash@{0}: WIP on master: 70f0d95 Add user role to localStorage on user login
 
 You can see one stash data is removed (popped) from stash list and stash@{1} became stash@{0}.

 Recovering from a lost commit 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 In case you have reverted back to a past commit and lost a newer commit you can recover the lost commit by running 
 git reflog
 
 Then find your lost commit, and reset back to it by doing 
 git reset HEAD --hard <sha1-of-commit>

 Recovering from a reset 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 With Git, you can (almost) always turn the clock back 
 Don't be afraid to experiment with commands that rewrite history*. Git doesn't delete your commits for 90 days by default, and during that time you can easily recover them from the reflog: 
 $ git reset @~3   # go back 3 commits
$ git reflog
c4f708b HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to @~3
2c52489 HEAD@{1}: commit: more changes
4a5246d HEAD@{2}: commit: make important changes
e8571e4 HEAD@{3}: commit: make some changes
... earlier commits ...
$ git reset 2c52489
... and you're back where you started
 
 *  Watch out for options like  --hard  and  --force  though — they can discard data. 
*   Also, avoid rewriting history on any branches you're collaborating on.

 Restore a deleted file after a commit 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 In case you have accidentally commited a delete on a file and later realized that you need it back. 
 First find the commit id of the commit that deleted your file. 
 git log --diff-filter=D --summary
 
 Will give you a sorted summary of commits which deleted files. 
 Then proceed to restore the file by 
 git checkout 81eeccf~1 <your-lost-file-name>
 
 (Replace  81eeccf with your own commit id)

 Restore file to a previous version 
 
 
 
 
 
 0 
 
 
 To restore a file to a previous version you can use  reset . 
 git reset <sha1-of-commit> <file-name>
 
 If you have already made local changes to the file (that you do not require!) you can also use the  --hard  option
