 Hiding secret data using a JSON file 
 
 
 
 
 
 22 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 When using a VCS such as Git or SVN, there are some secret data that must never be versioned (whether the repository is public or private). 
 Among those data, you find the  SECRET_KEY  setting and the database password. 
 A common practice to hide these settings from version control is to create a file  secrets.json  at the root of your project ( thanks " Two Scoops of Django " for the idea ): 
 {
    "SECRET_KEY": "N4HE:AMk:.Ader5354DR453TH8SHTQr",
    "DB_PASSWORD": "v3ry53cr3t"
}
 
 And add it to your ignore list ( .gitignore  for git): 
 *.py[co]
*.sw[po]
*~
/secrets.json
 
 Then add the following function to your  settings  module: 
 import json
import os
from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured

with open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'secrets.json')) as secrets_file:
    secrets = json.load(secrets_file)

def get_secret(setting, secrets=secrets):
    """Get secret setting or fail with ImproperlyConfigured"""
    try:
        return secrets[setting]
    except KeyError:
        raise ImproperlyConfigured("Set the {} setting".format(setting))
 
 Then fill the settings this way: 
 SECRET_KEY = get_secret('SECRET_KEY')
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgres',
        'NAME': 'db_name',
        'USER': 'username',
        'PASSWORD': get_secret('DB_PASSWORD'),
    },
}

 Using BASE_DIR to ensure app portability 
 
 
 
 
 
 13 
 
 
 It's a bad idea to hard code paths in your application. One should always use relative urls so that your code can work seamlessly across different machines.
The best way to set this up is to define a variable like this 
 import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
 
 Then use this  BASE_DIR  variable to define all your other settings. 
 TEMPLATE_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "templates")
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),

]
 
 And so on. This ensures that you can port your code across different machines without any worries. 
 However,  os.path  is a bit verbose. For instance if your settings module is  project.settings.dev , you will have to write: 
 BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
 
 An alternative is to use the  unipath  module (which you can install with  pip install unipath ). 
 from unipath import Path

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).ancestor(2)  # or ancestor(3) if using a submodule

TEMPLATE_PATH = BASE_DIR.child('templates')
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR.child('static'),
]

 Using Environment variables to manage Settings across servers 
 
 
 
 
 
 13 
 
 
 Using environment variables is a widely used way to setting an app's config depending on it environment, as stated in  The Twelve-Factor App . 
 As configurations are likely to change between deployment environments, this is a very interesting way to modify the configuration without having to dig in the app's source code, as well as keeping secrets outside the application files and source code repository. 
 In Django, the main settings are located as  settings.py  in your project's folder. As it is a simple Python file, you can use Python's  os  module from the standard library to access the environment (and even have appropriate defaults). 
 settings.py 
 import os

SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('APP_SECRET_KEY', 'unsafe-secret-key')

DEBUG = bool(os.environ.get('DJANGO_DEBUG', True) == 'False')

ALLOWED_HOSTS = os.environ.get('DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS', '').split()

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': os.environ.get('APP_DB_ENGINE', 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'),
        'NAME': os.environ.get('DB_NAME', 'db.sqlite'),    
        'USER': os.environ.get('DB_USER', ''),
        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
        'HOST': os.environ.get('DB_HOST', None),
        'PORT': os.environ.get('DB_PORT', None),
        'CONN_MAX_AGE': 600,
    }
}
 
 With Django you can change your database technology, so that you can use sqlite3 on your development machine (and that should be a sane default for committing to a source control system). Although this is possible it is not advisable: 
 
 Backing services, such as the app’s database, queueing system, or cache, is one area where dev/prod parity is important. ( The Twelve-Factor App - Dev/prod parity ) 
 
 For using a DATABASE_URL parameter for database connection, please take a look at the  related example .

 Using multiple settings 
 
 
 
 
 
 10 
 
 
 Django default project layout creates a single  settings.py . This is often useful to split it like this: 
 myprojectroot/
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings/
            __init__.py
            base.py
            dev.py
            prod.py
            tests.py
 
 This enables you to work with different settings according to whether you are in development, production, tests or whatever. 
 When moving from the default layout to this layout, the original  settings.py  becomes  settings/base.py . When every other submodule will "subclass"  settings/base.py  by starting with  from .base import * . For instance, here is what  settings/dev.py  may look like: 
 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from .base import *  # noqa

DEBUG = True
INSTALLED_APPS.extend([
    'debug_toolbar',
])
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
INTERNAL_IPS = ['192.168.0.51', '192.168.0.69']
 
 Alternative #1 
 For  django-admin  commands to work properly, you will have to set  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE  environment variable (which defaults to  myproject.settings ). In development, you will set it to  myproject.settings.dev . In production, you will set it to  myproject.settings.prod . If you use a virtualenv, best is to set it in your  postactivate  script: 
 #!/bin/sh
export PYTHONPATH="/home/me/django_projects/myproject:$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.4"
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="myproject.settings.dev"
 
 If you want to use a settings module that is not pointed by  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE  for one time, you can use the  --settings  option of  django-admin : 
 django-admin test --settings=myproject.settings.tests
 
 Alternative #2 
 If you want to leave  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE  at its default configuration ( myproject.settings ), you can simply tell the  settings  module which configuration to load by placing the import in your  __init__.py  file. 
 In the above example, the same result could be achieved by having an  __init__.py  set to: 
 from .dev import *

 djangoproject
├── config
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── requirements
│   │   ├── base.txt
│   │   ├── dev.txt
│   │   ├── test.txt
│   │   └── prod.txt
│   └── settings

 In  base.txt  file, place dependencies used in all environments. 
 # base.txt
Django==1.8.0
psycopg2==2.6.1
jinja2==2.8
 
 And in all other files, include base dependencies with  -r base.txt , and add  specific dependencies needed for the current environment. 
 # dev.txt
-r base.txt # includes all dependencies in `base.txt`

# specific dependencies only used in dev env
django-queryinspect==0.1.0
 
 # test.txt
-r base.txt # includes all dependencies in `base.txt`

# specific dependencies only used in test env
nose==1.3.7
django-nose==1.4
 
 # prod.txt
-r base.txt # includes all dependencies in `base.txt`

# specific dependencies only used in production env
django-queryinspect==0.1.0
gunicorn==19.3.0
django-storages-redux==1.3
boto==2.38.0
 
 Finally, to install dependencies. Example, on dev env :  pip install -r config/requirements/dev.txt

 Setting the timezone 
 
 
 
 
 
 6 
 
 
 You can set the timezone that will be used by Django in the  settings.py  file. Examples: 
 TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'  # use this, whenever possible
TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Berlin'
TIME_ZONE = 'Etc/GMT+1'
 
 Here is the list of valid timezones 
 When running in a  Windows  environment this must be set to the same as your  system time zone . 
 If you do not want Django to use timezone-aware datetimes: 
 USE_TZ = False
 
 Django best practices call for using  UTC  for storing information in the database: 
 
 Even if your website is available in only one time zone, it’s still
good practice to store data in UTC in your database. The main reason
is Daylight Saving Time (DST). Many countries have a system of DST,
where clocks are moved forward in spring and backward in autumn. If
you’re working in local time, you’re likely to encounter errors twice
a year, when the transitions happen.

 Accessing settings 
 
 
 
 
 
 4 
 
 
 Once you've got all your settings, you'll want to use them in your code. To do so, add the following import to your file: 
 from django.conf import settings
 
 You may then access your settings as attributes of the  settings  module, for example: 
 if not settings.DEBUG:
    email_user(user, message)

 Using a DATABASE_URL from the environment 
 
 
 
 
 
 2 
 
 
 In PaaS sites such as Heroku, it is usual to receive the database information as a single URL environment variable, instead of several parameters (host, port, user, password...). 
 There is a module,  dj_database_url  which automatically extracts the DATABASE_URL environment variable to a Python dictionary appropriate for injecting the database settings in Django. 
 Usage: 
 import dj_database_url

if os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'):
    DATABASES['default'] =
        dj_database_url.config(default=os.environ['DATABASE_URL'])
